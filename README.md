My own project using a Classification Tree model and a XGBoost model to seek key factors as to why students are dropping out.

The Classification Tree model provides more insights than XGBoost.

I used SMOTE within my XGBoost model in attempt to level out classes.

Dataset contains 36 features and 700 rows.
